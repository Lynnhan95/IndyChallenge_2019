## Animated Bubble Chart
Indiana High Educational Status 
All population Population by High Education Level (%)
Indiana Map
Here in this page, two factors of poverty level and education attainment are measured in an interactive bubble diagram. The primary logic is to find suspicious target which may need attention. We use the ratio of poverty population times the ratio of high educated population to get a distribution of the relevance for each county. The higher the more suspicious the county will be.
The tricky is that counties like Tippecanoe who is hosting many universities will be treated as suspicions subject that has both high ratio of educated people and high poverty level. We suggest the Census 2020 to specify the in school population and their attainment of education, in which could be deducted by total population of degree holder. That will diminish the affect of non-income students from the data base.
